    <p>These pancakes are not too thick, not too thin, but tender, light, buttery, and delicious. Anybody can add water to a boxed pancake mix, but you're better than that!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>cooking spray</li>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h4>Step 1</h4>
    <p>Sift together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a large bowl. Whisk in milk, melted butter, and egg until combined. Let batter rest for 5 minutes. Preheat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Spray with cooking spray.</p>

    <h4>Step 2</h4>
    <p>Pour batter into the hot skillet, about 1/4 cup batter for each pancake. Cook until bubbles appear on the sides and center of each pancake, 2 to 3 minutes.</p>

    <h4>Step 3</h4>
    <p>Flip and cook until the bottom is golden, 1 to 2 minutes.</p>

    <h4>Step 4</h4>
    <p>Serve with butter and maple syrup and enjoy!</p>
